    <p>Wake up to Reality
        Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world
        The longer you live
        The more you will realize
        That the only things that truly exist in this Reality are merely pain
        Suffering and futility
        Listen
        Everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light
        There will always be shadows To be found
        As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist
        The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace, initiates wars
        And Hatred is born in order to protect Love
        There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated
        I want to sever that fate of this world
        A world of only Victors
        A world of only Peace
        A world of only Love
        I will create such a World
        I... am the Ghost of the Uchiha
        For truly... this reality is Hell</p>
